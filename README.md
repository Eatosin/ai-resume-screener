## Project Overview (STAR Format)
- **Situation**: In 2025, recruiters receive 250+ resumes per role, struggling with volume overload, unconscious bias, keyword gaming, and inaccurate fit prediction. Traditional ATS tools are rigid and often unfair.
- **Task**: Build a simple, automated web app that screens resumes fairly using LLMs for semantic understanding, debiasing, and explainable scoring.
- **Action**: Developed a Streamlit app that handles PDF uploads, extracts text, runs custom LLM prompts (Mistral-7B-Instruct), and outputs ranked results with justifications.
- **Result**: Screens multiple resumes in seconds, reduces simulated bias via blind evaluation, provides clear explanations. Tested on my resume against AI Trainer JD → scored 92/100 with transferable skills highlighted.

This standalone project showcases prompt engineering, PDF processing, automation, and ethical AI—perfect for AI Trainer / data annotation roles.
