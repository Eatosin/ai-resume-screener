## ⚡ The Problem
Recruiters spend 6 seconds on a resume. Bias creeps in. Great candidates get missed because of keywords.
Standard parsers just look for "Python." They miss "Built a compiler in C++."

## 🧠 The Solution
**TalentAlign** is an AI Agent that reads resumes like a Senior Engineer.
It uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (1M Context Window) to analyze multiple candidates against a Job Description simultaneously.

### ✨ Key Features
*   **🚫 Blind Mode:** Automatically hides names, gender, and universities to reduce unconscious bias.
*   **📊 Skill Gap Analysis:** Doesn't just say "Match." It tells you exactly *what* is missing (e.g., "Candidate has Python but lacks CI/CD experience").
*   **📄 Bulk Processing:** Screen 10+ PDF resumes in seconds.
*   **json Output:** Generates structured data tables exportable to CSV/PDF.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  **Paste** a Job Description on the left.
2.  **Upload** PDF Resumes on the right.
3.  **Toggle** "Blind Mode" if you want unbiased ranking.
4.  **Click** "Screen Candidates."

The AI will generate a ranked leaderboard and detailed scorecards for every applicant.
